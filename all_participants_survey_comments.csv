2,227985121_227985121,Les commandes ne répondent plus et beaucoup de bons coups se trouvent arrêtés alors que le mouvement était 'fluide'. ,"Non, mais je m'y suis adaptée. Au fur et à mesure du jeu j'ai compris que la moindre modification dans mes mouvements avec la main droite (souris) pouvaient engendrer une correction de la part de l'ordinateur. Aussi j'ai modifié ma stratégie de jeu. Etant gauchère, appuyer sur le clavier ne m'a pas posé de problème mais la coordination antre main gauche et droite était trop rapide après le début de l'appui sur la barre du clavier ce qui a engendré beaucoup de corrections de la part du programme. Donc un peu de frustration de mon côté. IL a fallu que je m'adapte à ces corrections et que je ralentisse mes mouvements afin de retomber dans le cercle vertueux des récompenses. Ensuite les temps s'améliorent...","Etonnante prise de conscience de l'amélioration des mouvements,  des temps de réponse et des stratégies en fonction des scores. ON a l'impression de ""voir"" ce qui se passe dans notre cerveau adaptatif !"

Sometimes i was simply a little slower to click the one-one-out, but i got a warning. Other times i didn't even understand how my movement wasn't smooth; it seemed way too sensitive. But perhaps the study required this precision. Otherwise, very fun concept!"

19,10502553_10502553,It was much easier. The last one was particularly weird as it looked like the odd one was selected way before the click. In general it got easier and easier to not be flagged especially for the smooth movement rule ,No ,Hard!!
20,169472058_169472058,It felt like there was some auto-clicking once I unlocked the grid and started moving the pointer towards the objective,"Not intentionally, but I felt like pushing myself to click faster and more accurately made me feel tired. I feel like I started underperforming.","Such an interesting experiment. I was wondering if you're trying to create an AI to help enhance precision on clicks on the computer, such as the ""aimbot"" that can be used in FPS videogames, but for computer accesibility or something related."

Cependant, considérant la vitesse de réalisation de la tâche, j'ai du mal à établir si la validation intervenait automatiquement au survol du bon item par mon curseur ou sur une base de temps (cad. indépendant de la position de mon curseur)

Dans un premier temps j'ai privilégié la fixité des règles du jeu comme cadre de travail en pensant qu'il s'agissait d'un bug. 

Je dirai que c'est à travers la répétition du phénomène que j'ai commencé à mettre en doute le fonctionnement de l'exercice, mais à posteriori j'ignore si j'avais déjà identifié cet alternative ou si elle est apparue au moment de la présentation de la question.

De plus, la dimension compétitive du jeu associé à des traitements relativement rapides m'ont incité à me prévaloir du dysfonctionnement apparent pour ""gagner des points"" malhonnêtement.",Oui.
